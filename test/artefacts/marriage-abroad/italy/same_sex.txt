Civil partnership in Italy

## Before you start
Contact the local Italian ‘comune’ (town hall) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you and your partner will need.

## Prove you’re free to register a civil partnership
What you need to do depends on where you are.

You need to prove you’re legally allowed to register a civil partnership by getting:

- a certificate of no impediment (CNI) and a statutory declaration if you’re in the UK
- a ‘Nulla Osta’ if you’re in Italy

If you’re not in the UK or Italy you’ll need to either:

- go to the UK and get a CNI
- go to Italy and get a Nulla Osta

^Your partner will also need proof that they’re free to register a civil partnership. The documents they need might be different if they’re not British.^

### Get a CNI and a statutory declaration
You’ll need to get a CNI and a statutory declaration if you’re in the UK.

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage. A CNI costs £35.

^Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)^

You’ll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.

Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.

Your CNI won’t expire if it was issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. CNIs issued in Scotland expire after 3 months. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)

You should also check with the comune (town hall) to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.

You’ll also need to provide more information in a ‘statutory declaration’. You need to sign it in front of a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/) in the UK. They’ll charge you a fee.

There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

### Get a Nulla Osta
You’ll need to get a Nulla Osta if you’re in Italy.

To get a Nulla Osta, [make an appointment at the British Embassy in Rome](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-rome/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker) to give notice of your civil partnership. Your partner doesn’t have to come with you.

It costs £50 to give notice and £50 for the Nulla Osta. If you want to pay in cash you need to pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/italy-consular-fees).

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- your partner’s passport (or a copy of their passport if they’re not British)
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) including your parents’ details
- proof that you live in Italy or you’ve been in Italy for at least 3 days - for example a residency certificate, utility bill or boarding pass
- [notice for civil partnership](/government/publications/notice-for-registration-of-civil-partnership-under-italian-law) and [civil partnership declaration](/government/publications/declaration-for-formation-of-civil-partnership-under-italian-law) - you can fill in (but not sign) these in advance

^You can’t use an Italian address on your notice for civil partnership if you don’t have a residency certificate.^

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- evidence of nationality or residence - if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

The British embassy will display your notice of civil partnership publicly for 7 days. If nobody registers an objection, your Nulla Osta should be ready within 2 weeks of giving your notice. You can collect it in person or have it delivered by post.

You don’t need to stay in the country while your notice is displayed.

### If you’ve changed your name
The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passport - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the civil partnership to go ahead.

You’ll need to provide evidence of your name change if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll).

### Get your documents translated and legalised
You need to get your statutory declaration and CNI [legalised](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).

You’ll also need to get a certified translation of your CNI. You need to use an [approved translator](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters).

You need to get your supporting documents (for example, a decree absolute) [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) if they’re not in English or Italian.

You’ll be charged fees for translating your documents.

## Register your civil partnership
To register your civil partnership, you’ll need either:

- a CNI and a statutory declaration
- a Nulla Osta

You’ll need to give the original documents to the registrar at the comune (town hall).

## After you register your civil partnership
Your civil partnership should be recognised in the UK if you follow the correct process according to local law - you won’t need to register it in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
